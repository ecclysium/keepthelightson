Keep The Lights On. By Ecclysium.


If you don't...


BASIC CONTROLS:
JD is effectively a cursed snowglobe.
You can barely effect their life, however, when they are feeling very unwell you might have more sway.

When they are present, you may roll your mousewheel over them to convince them to sleep.
When they are not turning the wheel themself, you can turn it by circling your cursor over it.

Clicking on the boxes lets you see inventory (not all items are useful yet.)
Clicking on the generator tells you about variables effecting JD.
Clicking on the ladder lets you see statistics, vitals, and from there access the game settings.

JD does not have much dialogue yet, but mechanics are mostly done for first release! Thanks for testing!
